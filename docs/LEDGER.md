# Kairos umbrella — the ledger

Every number the umbrella claims, with the run that produced it. Package
numbers live in each package's own `docs/LEDGER.md`; this file carries the
family-level facts: the oracle, the fleet gate, the conformance corpus.

Method discipline (mission plan §2.7): an external oracle before a
self-metric; counters before clocks; the method line names the machine, the
pinning and the arm order for anything timed. Nothing here is timed yet.

## Conformance — the Rust kernel against the C kernel (2026-09-09, K1)

The headline: **`rusty_rtos_kernel` reproduces the C kernel's trace exactly**,
for all nine scenarios of the K1 corpus, for 100,000 ticks each, counters
included. 8,408,764 lines of agreement, and not a sample among them.

| scenario | lines identical at 100,000 ticks | ticks | yields | exits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dynamic` | 1,219,231 | 100000 | 179588 | 1066689 |
| `PollQ` | 117,417 | 100051 | 2056 | 105608 |
| `BlockQ` | 1,344,460 | 100011 | 195466 | 1282272 |
| `semtest` | 1,503,634 | 100000 | 64837 | 1163649 |
| `countsem` | 966,326 | 100000 | 21001 | 1280002 |
| `recmutex` | 1,385,862 | 100000 | 40923 | 1068657 |
| `blocktim` | 131,384 | 100062 | 4505 | 114313 |
| `QPeek` | 486,871 | 100000 | 88964 | 414030 |
| `GenQTest` | 1,253,579 | 100000 | 150435 | 1299809 |

| fact | value | method |
|---|---|---|
| the gate | `kairos conform --all --ticks 100000` | runs `rusty_rtos_demo`'s sim (release) and the instrumented C oracle, compares line for line, and fails at the first difference. Not a sample and not a summary — every line, the verdict line included |
| counters | ticks, yields, exits and line counts identical on both sides, every scenario | the harness's `KAIROS_RESULT` line, from the patched port's counters on the C side and `SimPort`'s on ours |
| the same nine at 2000 ticks | identical, and stored | `kairos oracle trace --all`: each scenario run twice on the C kernel, refused unless byte-identical, kept as `oracle/traces/<scenario>.trace.zst` (rusty_zstd level 19, round trip verified) |
| offline regression | all nine pinned by counters, line count, byte count and an FNV-1a/64 digest **of the C kernel's own trace file** | `rusty_rtos_demo`'s `tests/conformance.rs`; it fails on drift without a C toolchain, which is what CI has. Poisoning one pinned number fails the test, so the gate is not vacuous |
| Miri over the corpus | green: all nine scenarios, twice each, at 20 ticks | `cargo +nightly miri test` in `rusty_rtos_demo`, 13 minutes; this is what puts the arenas and the lists through an interpreter that checks them, rather than 11 unit tests |

**What "identical" means here.** The trace is one line per scheduling
decision — task create, switch in and out, tick, delay, suspend, resume,
priority set, queue send and receive, and the list moves each causes. Both
kernels emit it from their own `trace*` seam, and the diff includes the
tick each line carries. Sim time on both sides is a count of outermost
critical-section exits (`ORACLES.md`, sim contract v1), so agreeing on the
trace means agreeing on *when* as well as *what*.

**What it does not mean.** Nothing here has run on a chip and nothing is
timed. The Rust kernel does not switch stacks — on the sim a task is a
resumable state machine and the runner drives it, which is what lets the
kernel be `forbid(unsafe)`. The port's context switch is K3's.

### Five things the C port does that a stackless kernel has to say out loud

Each cost a diff, and each is now a named mechanism rather than a fudge:

1. **A task's first switch-in resets the critical nesting count.**
   `prvWaitForStart` in the Posix port is one line: `uxCriticalNesting = 0`.
   A real port hands a new task a fresh stack, so the outgoing task's open
   sections are not on it.
2. **Nesting is per task, saved and restored across a switch**
   (`uxSavedCriticalNesting` in `prvSwitchThread`), so the exits that unwind
   an abandoned frame are *deferred* to when that task runs again, not lost
   and not taken early. The kernel records them (`owed_exits`) and pays them
   in `resume_pending`.
3. **The tick handler's nesting bump is not a critical section.** It is a
   raw `uxCriticalNesting++`/`--`, never `vPortExitCritical`, so it must not
   create an owed exit. Modelling it as one invented a tick at every switch
   the tick itself caused.
4. **A thread stops at the switch; a stackless call does not.** The frame
   the scheduler switched away from is still on the machine and runs to its
   end — closing the sections it had open *and*, on some paths, opening one
   more. `xQueueReceive`'s timeout path calls `prvIsQueueEmpty` after the
   `xTaskResumeAll` that may have switched the caller out, and on the C side
   that section is charged to the task when it next runs. So the port stops
   counting the tail's exits as sim time and *tallies* them
   (`Port::begin_unwind` / `end_unwind`), and the kernel replays the tally
   on resume. Counting rather than discarding is the whole point: an earlier
   version discarded exactly the sections that were open, which was right
   until a tail opened one of its own. It cost `blocktim` a divergence that
   the totals hid completely — ticks, yields, exits and line count all
   agreed at 59,000 ticks while one exit sat 1,377 lines too early.
5. **The heap costs time.** Every `heap_N.c` wraps its `malloc` in
   `vTaskSuspendAll()` / `xTaskResumeAll()`, and `xTaskResumeAll` is a
   critical section. So on the C side creating a queue *after* the scheduler
   has started costs one more outermost exit than creating it before. This
   kernel allocates nothing, so it spends the exit deliberately, under
   `Config::DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION` — true for the Posix demo configuration,
   false for silicon, where the exit is not there to spend. `GenQTest`
   creates a mutex from a running task, and that is where it showed up.

The debugging tool that found all five: `KAIROS_TRACE_EXITS=1` on both
sides adds a ` #<exits>` column to every trace line, and `kairos conform
--exits` compares them. The events agreed for 1,598 lines after the
accounting had already drifted, so the column is the diagnosis and the event
is only the symptom.

## The oracle (2026-09-09)

| fact | value | method |
|---|---|---|
| C oracle builds on this machine | yes | `kairos oracle build dynamic`: `cc` (gcc 15.2) under WSL2 Ubuntu on the Windows 11 host, `-O0 -g -Wall`, no CMake; sources = 6 kernel files + Posix `port.c` (patched, 6 exact-anchor edits) + `wait_for_event.c` + `heap_3.c` + `oracle/harness/*.c` + `Demo/Common/Minimal/dynamic.c`; FreeRTOS-Kernel `V11.3.1` @ `3a22924e`, classic repo @ `f4fcc3b2` (`ORACLES.md`) |
| `dynamic` trace is reproducible | byte-identical across two consecutive runs | `kairos oracle trace dynamic --ticks 2000`: the verb runs the binary twice and refuses a differing pair; stored as `oracle/traces/dynamic.trace.zst` (rusty_zstd 0.2.3, level 19: 757,457 → 50,346 bytes, decompressed and compared before it is kept; `kairos oracle cat dynamic` prints it) |
| `dynamic` trace, 2000 ticks | 24,403 lines (24,402 events + the `KAIROS_RESULT` line) | sim contract v1 (`ORACLES.md`): idle-hook tick + a tick every 16th outermost critical-section exit; the demo's own `xAreDynamicPriorityTasksStillRunning()` returned pass |
| counters at the end of the run | ticks 2000, yields 3589, critical exits 21,346 | the `KAIROS_RESULT` line the harness prints from the patched port's counters |
| event mix (from `kairos oracle cat dynamic`) | TASK_SWITCHED_IN 4703, TASK_SWITCHED_OUT 4702, MOVED_TASK_TO_READY_STATE 4032, TASK_PRIORITY_SET 3952, QUEUE_RECEIVE_FAILED 3933, TASK_INCREMENT_TICK 2887, TASK_DELAY 52, MOVED_TASK_TO_DELAYED_LIST 52, TASK_SUSPEND 23, TASK_RESUME 22, QUEUE_SEND 16, QUEUE_RECEIVE 16, TASK_CREATE 8, QUEUE_CREATE 2, TASK_DELAY_UNTIL 1, STARTING_SCHEDULER 1 | `awk '{print $2}' oracle/traces/dynamic.trace \| sort \| uniq -c` |
| TASK_INCREMENT_TICK lines vs ticks | 2887 lines for 2000 ticks | ticks delivered while the scheduler is suspended are pended and replayed by `xTaskResumeAll`, which fires the macro again; the trace records the kernel's view, and so must ours |

The first run of the unpatched contract (a tick on every 16th *yield*) never
finished: `dynamic`'s SUSP_RX task polls a queue without blocking and never
yields, so no tick could arrive and the trace grew past 8 GB before it was
killed. That is why v1 counts critical-section exits (decision log, mission
plan §8), and why the `trace` verb now runs under `timeout 300` and
`ulimit -f 1048576`.

## The fleet gate (2026-09-09)

| fact | value | method |
|---|---|---|
| `rusty_rtos_core` passes the fleet gate | yes | `kairos check rusty_rtos_core --fmt --clippy --test --deny`: fmt, clippy `-D warnings` under the workspace lint policy, 34 host tests, `cargo deny check` (advisories, bans, licenses, sources all ok), then `cargo check` on `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`, `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf`, `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`, `riscv32imafc-unknown-none-elf` with and without `alloc` (8 rungs) |
| `rusty_rtos_kernel`, `_port`, `_demo` pass the fleet gate | yes | the same command; each also checked on the four bare-metal targets, `no_std` and `no_std + alloc` |
| Miri | green on `rusty_rtos_core`, `_kernel` and `_port` unit tests, and on all nine corpus scenarios | `cargo +nightly miri test --workspace` in each; the corpus run is `rusty_rtos_demo`'s determinism test, which drops to 20 ticks under `cfg!(miri)` so the interpreter can finish (13 minutes) |
| `cargo audit` on `rusty_rtos_core` | 0 advisories over 17 locked crates | advisory-db of 2026-09-09 (1243 advisories) |

## The arena-and-list cost row (2026-09-09, K1)

Mission plan §2.5 chose index-linked lists over pointer-linked ones so the
core could be `forbid(unsafe)`, and wrote down the price of being wrong: a
K1 ledger row above **1.25×** the C list cost reopens the decision. Here is
the row. **It is 2.08×, and the revisit condition has fired.**

| arm | instructions per list operation | vs C |
|---|---|---|
| `FreeRTOS-Kernel/list.c`, gcc 15.2 `-O2` | **22.32** | 1.00× |
| the same, gcc 15.2 `-O3` | 21.82 | 0.98× |
| `rusty_rtos_core::list`, rustc 1.98 release (opt-level 3, LTO, one codegen unit) | **46.45** | **2.08×** |

**Method** — `bench/list-cost/run.sh`, one command, on WSL2 Ubuntu on this
Windows 11 host. It is not timed: instructions are counted with callgrind,
which is deterministic, so there is no noise floor to argue about and no
reason to interleave the arms.

- **Work-count parity, enforced.** Both arms run the same 40 operations per
  round on 8 items — 8 appends to a ready list, 8 round-robin picks, 8
  removals, 8 ordered inserts into a delayed list, 8 more removals — which
  is the mix `prvAddTaskToReadyList`, `taskSELECT_HIGHEST_PRIORITY_TASK` and
  `prvAddCurrentTaskToDelayedList` actually make. Both sort the same
  pseudo-random values from the same xorshift, spelled the same way.
- **A correctness gate.** Each arm prints a checksum of every value its list
  operations returned. They match (`7de9075f4deb23e5`), and the script stops
  if they ever do not: two instruction counts of two different programs are
  not a comparison.
- **The cost is a slope, not a count.** Each arm is counted at 100k, 200k
  and 300k rounds and the cost of a round is the difference, so process
  start-up, the dynamic loader, libc and the final `printf` cancel exactly
  instead of being estimated away. The second difference is printed as the
  linearity check: −8,756 on 89M for C and −32,213 on 186M for Rust, that
  is 0.01% and 0.017%, so the counts are affine in the round count and the
  slope is a slope.
- The C arm compiles `FreeRTOS-Kernel/list.c` unmodified, from the pinned
  V11.3.1 checkout.

**Where the 24 extra instructions go.** Not to the index arithmetic. Every
link the C follows with one dereference costs us a branch (is this link an
item or a list's end marker?) plus a bounds check plus the load, and there
are about five link accesses in each of `insert_end`, `remove` and
`insert` — several of them re-validating a handle the same call already
validated. Two changes are visible from here, neither of which touches the
decision itself: put the end markers in the same array as the items so the
branch disappears, and validate a handle once per call rather than once per
access.

**What this row does and does not say.** It is a static count of one data
structure on x86-64, not a scheduler benchmark and not a number from a chip:
it says nothing about how often these operations run, about cache behaviour,
or about what a Cortex-M4 makes of the same code. The scheduler-level
figure — what a context switch costs end to end — is K3's, with the first
silicon and an A/B against the C kernel on the same board. **The decision is
the owner's:** the plan's condition has fired, so §2.5's "handles are
indices, never pointers" gets a decision-log row, either reaffirming it with
this price attached or funding the two changes above and re-running this
same script.
